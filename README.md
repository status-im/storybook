# Stability

Welcome to Status' [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a development environment for UI components. Stability lets you browse our component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components with us! Currently these are only React web components, but there is, as the saying goes, much more to the story.

## Goals

The goal of this repo specifically is to develop "Status-styled" components based on the work of our Product Designers that can be easily re-used by developers building DApps for Status. This allows them to focus on more important code - like smart contracts - and easily construct the UI out of work already done.

However, this is not the long-term goal we really want to achieve. This must be a story worth re-telling. So, we're working with [Aragon](https://ui.aragon.one) and [Bounties Network](https://components.bounties.network) on something called [Lorikeet](https://lorikeet.design). Both teams have proven UI track records (and awards) and are closely aligned with us on several goals at an organisational level (DAOs and bounties/payout flows in general).

With some help from our friends, hopefully we can create an atomic component library much like Material UI which includes support for as much web3 functionality as possible.

This, ideally, would take the form of a design language/system/spec/sketch/figma with multiple implementations which could render to many render targets, including:

1. react web (website/storybook/pwa)
2. react native (ios/android)
3. server side
5. [extensions](https://status.im/extensions/)
5. even some web vr/ar stuff (?)
